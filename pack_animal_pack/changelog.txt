Pack Animal Pack

TODOs:
- Look into adding a location check for altars and only add one if needed.
- Consider adding a curse for failure on the cthulhu quest.
- Look into using milk for desert movement.
- Mutations from the goat quest will need further play testing as they may be underpowered considering their
    rarity, the potential difficulty of the quest, and due to gaining an ailment with them.
- Think about more combo variety for the new mutation dice since these are character attacks:
    tentacle + awareness = parry / disable? - shield and can stun weapon dice?
    vclaw_1 + magic = antidote? - small heal, removes poison
    vclaw_2 + awareness + sword = disembowel? - causes bleeding
    shell + agility = deflect? - strong shield
    shell + stability + shield = dermal fortress? - super strong shield
    ram + agility = charge?
    ram + agility + awareness = resounding charge? stampede - group stun?
    mhorns + stability + sword = impale? - causes massive bleeding
- Add a check to milk production to prevent the party from becoming overburdened. Do not milk automatically.
- Add some method of customizing the outfitter description text based on the number of animals hired. If all
    have been hired then the description should include an empty pen.
- Build in allowing the player to know whether they are purchasing a male or female pack animal at the outfitter.
- Make animal selection at outfitter based on the biome.
