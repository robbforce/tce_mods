TODOs:
- Look into adding a location check for altars and only add one if needed.
- Consider adding a curse for failure on the cthulhu quest.
- Look into using milk for desert movement.
- Mutations from the goat quest will need further play testing as they may be underpowered considering their
    rarity, the potential difficulty of the quest, and due to gaining an ailment with them.
- Think about more combo variety for the new mutation dice since these are character attacks:
    tentacle + awareness = tentacle parry?
    vclaw_1 + magic = antidote?
    vclaw_2 + awareness + sword = disembowel?
    shell + agility = deflect?
    shell + stability + shield = dermal fortress?
    ram + agility = charge?
    ram + agility + awareness = resounding charge?
    mhorns + stability + sword = impale?
- Add a check to milk production to prevent the party from becoming overburdened. Do not milk automatically.
- Add horse chat at celebration.
