Pack Animal Pack

TODOs:
- All the other animals: yak, bactrian camel, ox, mule
- Look into adding a location check for altars and only add one if needed.
- Consider adding a curse for failure on the cthulhu quest.
- Look into using milk for desert movement.
- Mutations from the goat quest will need further play testing as they may be underpowered considering their
    rarity, the potential difficulty of the quest, and due to gaining an ailment with them.
- Think about more combo variety for the new mutation dice since these are character attacks:
    tentacle + awareness = parry / disable? - shield and stun weapon dice?
    vclaw_1 + magic = antidote? - small heal, removes poison
    vclaw_2 + awareness + sword = disembowel? - causes bleeding
    shell + agility = deflect? - strong shield
    shell + stability + shield = dermal fortress? - super strong shield
    ram + agility = charge?
    ram + agility + awareness = resounding charge? stampede - group stun?
    mhorns + stability + sword = impale? - causes massive bleeding
- Add a check to milk production to prevent the party from becoming overburdened. Do not milk automatically
    when inventory is maxed.
- Make animal selection at outfitter based on the biome.
- Fix milk expiration so it doesn't stack up like it does now.
- Add some method of customizing the outfitter description text based on the number of animals hired. If all
    have been hired then the description should include an empty pen.
- Work on the randomization of the outfitter for villages. At world gen? Possibly set a location flag at that
    time, then pick that flag up at the sublocation event to add the outfitter, and again during village enter.
- Consider adding the barter text flavor when exiting the barter screen. "You couldn't help notice the outfitter's
    equipment selection looked rather bare."
- Purchasing an animal should be tied into a custom event screen where the animals are on display similarly to
    the slave inspection.

v0.02 - Urban Goatfitters - 2018-09-21
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a working outfitter event / location that is spawned with native villages as a sublocation. When an
  outfitter is available the village will have an Outfitter action that "moves" the party via teleport to
  the outfitter location, which then provides a unique barter inventory, along with a selection of pack
  animals for trade. The goat sacrifice quest would've required a good deal of luck to recruit a goat in a
  village, so this outfitter was added to mitigate that. If the party has the goat sacrifice quest then an
  outfitter will always have at least 1 goat for purchase.
- Tweaks to goat cheese values to make a perfect round more valuable in missions and polar stations. Also
  added autoremove = true since the cheese would mold before the next expedition.
- Added horse and goat chat messages for celebrations.

v0.01 - Initial build - 2018-09-07
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Combined the goat and horse mods into an organized single large mod, using corrupted lands as an example.
